I really need to figure out what I actually want this thing to do
- I need a concrete idea of what it can practically do that would be useful
- I need a concrete idea of what it means to be a project manager
- I need a concrete idea of what can be done with github
- I need a concrete idea of something I would find useful
- I need a concrete understanding of some specific things that the github MCP server can do

I need very specific and detailed use cases that I can generalize from to define specifically what this does and how it does it

For safety reasons, it probably makes sense that there is no initial conversation to hire tom, so that I know that tom can only be used to support himself and if anyone else wanted to use him, they'd have to host him
