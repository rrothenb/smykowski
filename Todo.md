I really need to figure out what I actually want this thing to do
- I need a concrete idea of what it can practically do that would be useful
- I need a concrete idea of what it means to be a project manager
- I need a concrete idea of what can be done with github
- I need a concrete idea of something I would find useful
- I need a concrete understanding of some specific things that the github MCP server can do

I need very specific and detailed use cases that I can generalize from to define specifically what this does and how it does it

For safety reasons, it probably makes sense that there is no initial conversation to hire tom, so that I know that tom can only be used to support himself and if anyone else wanted to use him, they'd have to host him

In order for it to be useful for me, I'm going to have to come up with things it can do for a one person team.
- To start, that may be the only thing I need to support
- What does that look like?
- This might actually be the hardest question of all to answer.  I'm having trouble thinking of things it could usefully do for me while I develop it.

Potential use cases
- Tom should ignore emails that don't originate from GitHub
- Tom should respond to mentions in GitHub discussions, issues, and pull requests 
- Tom should respond in character always
- Tom should indicate when he doesn't know how to do something
- Tom should not know how to do anything unrelated to what he's been designed to do

My first use cases should not require the process MCP server
- Practically speaking, I won't know what sorts of things I'll want Tom to do until I have some experience trying to manage a project myself using the available GitHub tools

Very first step is installing claude code and hooking up the github MCP server and trying to use issues, projects, and wikis

First two steps
- trying to use issues, projects, and wikis manually on smykowski
- installing claude code and hooking up the github MCP server and trying to continue using issues, projects, and wikis via claude
